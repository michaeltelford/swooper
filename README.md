# Swooper

Swooper is a demo application for the [Swoop](https://github.com/michaeltelford/swoop) golang library.

Take a look at the `main.go` file to see how to use the library. Also pay attention to the `templates/*` directory structure which is referenced in the `main.go` file.

When you're ready to start the app run the following command:

    $ go run main.go
